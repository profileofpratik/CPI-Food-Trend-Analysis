# CPI-Food-Trend-Analysis
Noticed your grocery bills creeping up? So did I! Using Tableau and U.S. CPI data on food prices (June 2024), I found some interesting trends


📈 Slide 1: What's Pushing Up Grocery Bills? Looking at my own shopping habits, I noticed essentials like eggs have surged by 10.2%. Oils and sweets aren't far behind with increases around 4% and 2%. Interestingly, prices for fresh vegetables and dairy products have actually decreased. Maybe it’s time to add more greens and milk to the shopping cart!

📊 Slide 2: 2023 Prices vs. 2024 Predictions When comparing actual prices from 2023 to the predictions for 2024, it’s striking to see some essentials like eggs and dairy projected to cost less. It will be interesting to see how accurate these forecasts turn out by the end of this year.

🍽️ Slide 3: Cost of Home Cooking vs. Dining Out 2022 was a standout year with food prices skyrocketing both at home and dining out. However, data shows that restaurant meals have been rising in cost much faster than home-cooked meals, reinforcing the idea that cooking at home can be a budget saver.

🌐 Slide 4: General Food Price Trends The overall food CPI reveals a high spike in 2022. Projections for the next couple of years, however, suggest a more manageable annual inflation rate of about 2-2.5%.

📉 Slide 5: Understanding the Food CPI Calculation Diving deeper into how food CPI is calculated, it’s clear that every food category from meats to vegetables significantly impacts the overall index, contributing to 13.4% of the total CPI. It's essential to understand these factors when planning our budgets.

Insights: This project didn’t just enhance my skills in Tableau; it offered real insights that can help us all make more informed choices about our spending. These percentages aren’t just numbers—they’re the story of our everyday expenses.
